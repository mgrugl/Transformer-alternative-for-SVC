# Transformer-alternative-for-SVC
Alternate transformer.py for Stable Video Camera on Windows.
The original transformers.py explicitly requested the FLASH_ATTENTION backend for scaled dot-product attention using sdpa_kernel. This caused runtime errors on my system.

This modified version replaces that explicit request. Instead, it now forces PyTorch to use the EFFICIENT_ATTENTION backend via sdpa_kernel([SDPBackend.EFFICIENT_ATTENTION]). This change was necessary to find a compatible attention implementation that worked correctly and avoided out-of-memory errors on my specific hardware (RTX 4090) and PyTorch/CUDA environment, enabling successful execution.
Perhaps it helps others with the same issues.
